# Citibike Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to understand the Citibike usage in NYC and analyze ways in which is could be a sound business venture in Des Moins, Iowa.  The analysis included parsing Citibike data to look at usage rates across locations thorughout NYC, usage by gender, weekday, and time of day.

## Results
This [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/caroline8407/viz/CitibikeChallengeStory/CitibikeChallengeStory) to the workbook showcases the below analysis.

The analysis for each graphic is as follows:

![Checkout Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958734-1c842a68-f075-48ab-ab7e-2fb592392d18.png)

- This chart displays the number of bikes used per trip duration.  The shortest trip durations have the highest usage.  In particular, trips under 20min have significantly more bikes checked-out.  Trips longer than 1 hour have about the same number of bikes checked-out.

![Checkout Time by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958738-68526afb-6f0d-4fe2-8aaa-667f0a7c01d5.png)

- Males have a higher usage compared to females, but both genders have a similar usage of bikes per trip duration.  Shorter trip durations are more popular for both genders compared to longer trip durations. 

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958753-37b1213d-b480-4266-8273-d9d494d6aa81.png)

-  The heatmap shows the popular stop time for customers is around 8am and 5pm-6pm during the weekdays.  This is likely reflecting customers' work schedules. In addition, popular times on the weekend are from 10am to around 6pm and show more activity consitently throughout the day compared to during a weekday. 

![Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958763-cb488535-dc16-4223-9d80-c140dd86f684.png)

- The graphic shows that males are more active customers than females consistently throughout the week.  Despite males' higher usage, across both genders, there is a similar pattern with commuting times showing more activity than during the weekday and increased usage on the weekends. 

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958771-d8cf6bfb-0d15-43b9-a898-ed58efa1b385.png)

- Based on the data displayed in the heatmap, Males are more likely to be Subscribers compared to Females and also use the bikeshare service more often throughout the week.

![Top Start Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958781-ba81f4c8-d88c-4e7b-9bf1-1b2511d1907a.png)

- The top start locations are predominantely in Manhattan with a few in Brooklyn.  The start locations are more heavily concentrated in lower Manhattan likely reflecting where commuters come off of the subways and ferries.

![Top End Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85457256/132958796-44fd93f7-c01f-4be1-a350-7567f9ca05ae.png)

- The end loactions are in line with the start locations.  Again they could be around where the majority of commuters take subways or ferries.  In addition, because the start and end locations are very similar, this shows where the most bikes would need to be and also which bikes are likely to need more frequent repairs.

## Summary
Overall, males tend to use the Citibike service more than women.  However, they have similar usage patterns but on different scales.  In addition, the usage rates increase during the weekdays and commuting times.  

Further analysis and charts showing 1) a particular bike's usage to indicate when a bike will need to be repaired and 2) the number of bikes at the top Citibike stations would help in understanding the transferability of this business venture to another city and how to meet customer capacity/demand.
